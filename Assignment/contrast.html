  <p>My two favorite things have many things in common, original sound tracks for movies (<em>OSTs</em>) are a music genre of their own and indicate the audience on how to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvJOcVJyoEE">feel.</a> </p>
  <p>Edgar Wright is the king of using music in movies, weather it be using queen to inspire the characters on when to hit the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4tVH7BPb-Q">zombie</a> or syncing up guns to play the beat of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Y59oGt2XWU">soundtrack.</a></p>

  <p>Idlewild and The Dark Knight OST are two critically acclaimed albums, that while being movie soundtracks as taken seriously as albums.</p>
  <p>Finaly, the same story can be told in both forms of media but depending on the talent involved, you can either get an <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fantastic_four_2015">abomination of a project</a> or a <a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15359-operation-doomsday/">classic</a></p>

  <p>Both are about a man called DOOM and his downfall into insanity. While they are different, they follow the same source material.
